# Face-Recognition-and-Drowsiness-Detection
Project title- Face Recognition and Drowsiness Detection

# Problem statement – 

We will solve challenge of Face Recognition and Drowsiness detection by applying deep learning algorithms to live video data. The solution to this problem is by recognizing the face, mark the attendance, log the individual’s session time and put a drowsiness alert.

# Face Recognition –

•	Face recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a subject through an image, video or any audiovisual element of his face.

•	Face recognizers generally take face images and find the important points such as the corner of the mouth, an eyebrow, eyes, nose, lips, etc. Coordinates of these points are called facial-features points, there are such 68 points.



# Face Recognition steps –

•	Face Detection
•	Face Alignments
•	Feature Extraction
•	Face Recognition

 

# Drowsiness Detection - 

      Eye Aspect Ratio(EAR)
 
Top-left: A visualization of eye landmarks when then the eye is open. 

Top-right: Eye landmarks when the eye is closed.

Bottom: Plotting the eye aspect ratio over time. The dip in the eye aspect ratio indicates a blink.
